Task 1: POC on figuring out how to generate relevant strategy (upload txt, pdf, tag based etc)
Test cases:
1. Upload a plain text file (.txt) containing previous content and verify that the system can extract relevant information for use in content generation.
2. Upload a PDF file with formatted text and images, and confirm that the system can parse and extract useful content for generation.
3. Input a series of tags related to previous content and verify if the system can use these tags to inform the content generation process.

Task 2: Implementation of the upload strategy
Test cases:
1. Upload a large file (e.g., 10MB PDF) and verify that the system handles it without timing out or crashing.
2. Upload files with different encodings (e.g., UTF-8, UTF-16) and confirm that the content is correctly extracted and processed.
3. Attempt to upload an unsupported file type (e.g., .docx if not supported) and verify that the system provides an appropriate error message.

Task 3: UI Component
Test cases:
1. Drag and drop a file into the upload area and verify that it's correctly added to the system.
2. Select multiple files for upload and confirm that all files are processed and added to the relevant content pool.
3. After uploading, verify that the UI displays a summary of the extracted content or tags, allowing the user to edit or remove items before proceeding with content generation.
